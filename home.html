				<h2> What is BIONICLE? </h2>

				<p> The story of BIONICLE is hilariously complex, but in a nutshell it's about a giant humanoid robot with a massive world inside of it. Inside of this world live small beings called the Matoran as well as many other species. The story's antagonist - Makuta Teridax or simply The Makuta - strives to take over this universe. However, a team of heros called the Toa try to stop him by any means necessary. </p>
