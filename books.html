			<p> Since 2003 books have been the central part of story telling in BIONICLE. Unlike movies or video games, the books give a very detailed picture of the BIONICLE world, lore and characters. </p>
			
			<h2 class="keskitys"> Top 5 ways to obtain the BIONICLE books you haven't read </h2>
			
			<br>
			
			<h3 class="keskitys">1. Magically find them at a flea market </h3>
			
			<p> If you get really <i>really</i> lucky you might stumble upon a book or two at your local flea market or at a garage sale. This depends on where you live around the world though. </p>
			
			<br>
			
			<h3 class="keskitys"> 2. Steal them from a clueless young adult </h3>
			
			<p> Maybe they forgot they even owned the books, maybe they gave them to you willingly (for free). Just don't tell them how valuable they actually are. </p>
			
			<br>
			
			<h3 class="keskitys"> 3. Get them from the local library (is this even possible?) </h3>
			
			<p> Honestly, I don't know if any library has any of the books, but hey, if you find one or two then good for you! <span style="font-size:12px ;text-decoration:line-through;">(hehe that rhymed)</span></p>
			
			<br>
			
			<h3 class="keskitys"> 4. Buy them from Amazon and endure the outrageous shipping fees </h3>
			
			<p> The books are cheap, the shippings are high. Your choice. </p>
			
			<br>
			
			<h3 class="keskitys"> 5. Find them pirated online (honestly, this is the best way) </h3>
			
			<p>Don't have to go outside, check. Don't have to spend money, check. Feel bad for not paying for goods? How much money does Scholastic make from these Bionicle books these days anyway? Zero dollars? Yup. </p> 
						
			<h2 class="keskitys"> Serials </h2>
			
			<p> Serials surfaced in 2007 as yet another form of BIONICLE media. They are short stories slightly seperate from the main storyline, yet they piece together different events from the books and comics, for example. They are often written from the perspective of a side character. <br><br> Luckily reading the serials is not as big of a hassle as the books, as the former can be found <a href="https://biomediaproject.com/bmp/serials/">here</a>. </p>
